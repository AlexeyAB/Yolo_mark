# Yolo_mark
**Windows** & **Linux** GUI for marking bounded boxes of objects in images for training Yolo v3 and v2

* To compile on **Windows** open `yolo_mark.sln` in MSVS2013/2015, compile it **x64 & Release** and run the file: `x64/Release/yolo_mark.cmd`. Change paths in `yolo_mark.sln` to the OpenCV 2.x/3.x installed on your computer:

    * (right click on project) -> properties -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories: `C:\opencv_3.0\opencv\build\include;`
        
    * (right click on project) -> properties -> Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories: `C:\opencv_3.0\opencv\build\x64\vc14\lib;`

* To compile on **Linux** type in console 3 commands:
    ```
    cmake .
    make
    chmod +x linux_mark.sh
    ./linux_mark.sh
  
    ```

Supported both: OpenCV 2.x and OpenCV 3.x

--------

1. To test, simply run 
  * **on Windows:** `x64/Release/yolo_mark.cmd`
  * **on Linux:** `./linux_mark.sh`

2. To use for labeling your custom images:

 * delete all files from directory `x64/Release/data/img`
 * put your `.jpg`-images to this directory `x64/Release/data/img`
 * change numer of classes (objects for detection) in file `x64/Release/data/obj.data`: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark/blob/master/x64/Release/data/obj.data#L1
 * put names of objects, one for each line in file `x64/Release/data/obj.names`: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark/blob/master/x64/Release/data/obj.names
 * run file: `x64\Release\yolo_mark.cmd`

3. To training for your custom objects, you should change 2 lines in file `x64/Release/yolo-obj.cfg`:

 * set number of classes (objects): https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark/blob/master/x64/Release/yolo-obj.cfg#L230
 * set `filter`-value 
   * For Yolov2 `(classes + 5)*5`: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark/blob/master/x64/Release/yolo-obj.cfg#L224
   * For Yolov3 `(classes + 5)*3`

 3.1 Download pre-trained weights for the convolutional layers (76 MB): http://pjreddie.com/media/files/darknet19_448.conv.23 
 
 3.2 Put files: `yolo-obj.cfg`, `data/train.txt`, `data/obj.names`, `data/obj.data`, `darknet19_448.conv.23` and directory `data/img` near with executable `darknet`-file, and start training: `darknet detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg darknet19_448.conv.23`

#### How to get frames from videofile:

To get frames from videofile (save each N frame, in example N=10), you can use this command:
* on Windows: `yolo_mark.exe data/img cap_video test.mp4 10`
* on Linux: `./yolo_mark x64/Release/data/img cap_video test.mp4 10`

Directory `data/img` should be created before this. Also on Windows, the file `opencv_ffmpeg340_64.dll` from `opencv\build\bin` should be placed near with `yolo_mark.exe`.

As a result, many frames will be collected in the directory `data/img`. Then you can label them manually using such command: 
* on Windows: `yolo_mark.exe data/img data/train.txt data/obj.names`
* on Linux: `./yolo_mark x64/Release/data/img x64/Release/data/train.txt x64/Release/data/obj.names`
